The Summer Institute provides attendees with an overview of topics in High Performance Computing and Data Science to accelerate their learning process through highly interactive classes with hands-on tutorials on the Comet Supercomputer.  The program is aimed at researchers in academia and industry, especially in domains not traditionally engaged in supercomputing. Participants  only need to have basic programming experience and should be comfortable working in a Linux environment.
